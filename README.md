# What is the goal of the repository?
### This repository was created to complete assignment B3 of STATS545B. The goal of the assignment is to learn how to create my own Shiny App with R and add features to it. The files in the repository are:
#### app.R: is the R script used to create the app
#### penguins.csv is a file that contains the penguins dataset used in the app. 

# About the app: Find the Right Penguin
### This app was created so that a user can sort through penguins inside the palmerpenguins dataset to find only the ones that fit their specific criteria. The user inputs a range of body masses, the species of penguin, and the sex of the penguin and the output is a table of all of the penguins that fit that criteria. Copied below is a link to a running isntance of the app.
