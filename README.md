# What is the goal of the repository?
### This repository was created to complete assignment B3 of STATS545B. The goal of the assignment is to learn how to create my own Shiny App with R and add features to it. The files in the repository are:
#### app.R is the R script used to create the app for Assignment B4. It is modified code that was previously used to create Assignment B3.
#### penguins.csv is a file that contains the penguins dataset used in the app. 
#### www is the folder that contains the "palmer penguins" image that was retrieved from https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html

# About the App: Find the Right Penguin
### This app was created so that a user can sort through penguins inside the palmerpenguins dataset to find only the ones that fit their specific criteria. The user inputs a range of body masses, the species of penguin, and the sex of the penguin and the output is a table of all of the penguins that fit that criteria. The user is then able to download the table with a list of penguins that fit their criteria. Two versions of the app exist and are listed below:
